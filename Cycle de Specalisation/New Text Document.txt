SUMMARY: Introduction: Inguinal hernia is one of the most common general surgical operation world-wide accounting for 10-15% of all surgical procedures. Giant inguinoscrotal hernias (GISH) have been defined as those that extend below the midpoint of the inner thigh when the patient is in the standing position. Its management represents a challenge due to the risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). There are very few studies on GISH in Africa and in Cameroon. In this study we set out to describe the experience of Association des Competences pour une Vie Meilleure (ASCOVIME) in the management of GISH in rural areas in Cameroon.Methodology: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study in the ten regions Cameroon within 13 years (February 2011 to August 2024). Sampling included patients operated for GISH. Patients were classified such that: Type I had their sac reaching the mid-inner thigh; Type II with sac reaching a midline between the mid-thigh and the supra-patellar line; Type III with sac reaching the supra-patella; and Type IV with sac extending below the supra-patella or if associated to other hernias. Data analysis was done using software SPSS version 4.2.2 and Excel version 2016. Results were presented using mean, standard deviation and proportions.Results: GISH represented 0.39% of the surgical activities and 0.69% of groin hernias. We included 62 cases with a male predominance (sex ratio 11: 1). The average age was 54.71.1 [34 – 79] years. Majority of the participants were (66%) farmers. Most prevailing symptoms were abdominal pains 54(87.1%) and weight bearing sensation 47 (75.8%). Type II categories were the most frequent 30 (48.3%) followed by Type I 25(40.3%); Types III and IV represented a minority (5(8%) and 2(3.2%) respectively). The average length of evolution was 30.80.7 years [14-50]. More than half of the participants 55 (88.7%) had reducible hernia. Lichtenstein was the most practised 56.5% (35). The main per operative complications were bowel injury in 9.7% (06). Bowel resection in 22.6% (14 cases). We recorded 2 cases (3.2%) of ACS with a case fatality rate of 3.2%. Conclusion: GISH is a reality in our community. It is frequent in rural areas where populations are involved mainly in land ploughing activities. This condition impacts heavily social integration which can go right up to rejection. Its treatment relies on surgery, depending on the reducibility, and the dissection which can help prevent deadly complications mostly associated to Types III and IV; thus the need for appropriate management in centers of higher categories. Application of appropriate management orientation for the individual patients is the key to success treatment.Key words: Giant inguino-scrotal hernia; rural setting; surgical management; outcome
